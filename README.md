# PI-Bunny

This is a project that mimics the HAK5 Bash Bunny, using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W along with simple switches and RGB LEDs. With a homemade Pi Zero 2 W USB module and case, the cost is only about 1/10th of the Bash Bunny. Since it is based on the Raspberry Pi, I call this project "PI-Bunny".
